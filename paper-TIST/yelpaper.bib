@article{Grabowicz2012Social,
	Abstract = {<p>An increasing fraction of today's social interactions occur using
	online social media as communication channels. Recent worldwide events,
	such as social movements in Spain or revolts in the Middle East,
	highlight their capacity to boost people's coordination. Online networks
	display in general a rich internal structure where users can choose
	among different types and intensity of interactions. Despite this,
	there are still open questions regarding the social value of online
	interactions. For example, the existence of users with millions of
	online friends sheds doubts on the relevance of these relations.
	In this work, we focus on Twitter, one of the most popular online
	social networks, and find that the network formed by the basic type
	of connections is organized in groups. The activity of the users
	conforms to the landscape determined by such groups. Furthermore,
	Twitter's distinction between different types of interactions allows
	us to establish a parallelism between online and offline social networks:
	personal interactions are more likely to occur on internal links
	to the groups (the weakness of strong ties); events transmitting
	new information go preferentially through links connecting different
	groups (the strength of weak ties) or even more through links connecting
	to users belonging to several groups that act as brokers (the strength
	of intermediary ties).</p>},

@article{Kumar2010,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we undertake a large-scale study of online user behavior
	based on search and toolbar logs. We propose a new CCS taxonomy of
	pageviews consisting of Content (news, portals, games, verticals,
	multimedia), Communication (email, social networking, forums, blogs,
	chat), and Search (Web search, item search, multimedia search). We
	show that roughly half of all pageviews online are content, one-third
	are communications, and the remaining one-sixth are search. We then
	give further breakdowns to characterize the pageviews within each
	high-level category. We then study the extent to which pages of certain
	types are revisited by the same user over time, and the mechanisms
	by which users move from page to page, within and across hosts, and
	within and across page types. We consider robust schemes for assigning
	responsibility for a pageview to ancestors along the chain of referrals.
	We show that mail, news, and social networking pageviews are insular
	in nature, appearing primarily in homogeneous sessions of one type.
	Search pageviews, on the other hand, appear on the path to a disproportionate
	number of pageviews, but cannot be viewed as the principal mechanism
	by which those pageviews were reached. Finally, we study the burstiness
	of pageviews associated with a URL, and show that by and large, online
	browsing behavior is not significantly affected by "breaking" material
	with non-uniform visit frequency.},

@article{Lerman2007,
	Abstract = {The social media site Flickr allows users to upload their pho- tos,
	annotate them with tags, submit them to groups, and also to form
	social networks by adding other users as contacts. Flickr offers
	multiple ways of browsing or searching it. One option is tag search,
	which returns all images tagged with a specific keyword. If the keyword
	is ambiguous, e.g., {\^a}â‚¬{\oe}beetle{\^a}â‚¬ï¿½ could mean an insect or a car, tag
	search results will include many images that are not relevant to
	the sense the user had in mind when executing the query. We claim
	that users express their photography interests through the metadata
	they add in the form of contacts and image annotations. We show how
	to exploit this metadata to personalize search results for the user,
	thereby improving search performance. First, we show that we can
	significantly improve search precision by filtering tag search results
	by user{\^a}â‚¬{\texttrademark}s contacts or a larger social network that includes those
	contact{\^a}â‚¬{\texttrademark}s contacts. Secondly, we describe aprobabilisticmodel that
	takes advantage of tag information to discover latent topics contained
	in the search results. The users{\^a}â‚¬{\texttrademark} interests can similarly be described
	by the tags they used for annotating their images. The latent topics
	found by the model are then used to personalize search results by
	find- ing images on topics that are of interest to the user.},

	Abstract = { <p>To comprehend the hierarchical organization of large integrated
	systems, we introduce the hierarchical map equation, which reveals
	multilevel structures in networks. In this information-theoretic
	approach, we exploit the duality between compression and pattern
	detection; by compressing a description of a random walker as a proxy
	for real flow on a network, we find regularities in the network that
	induce this system-wide flow. Finding the shortest multilevel description
	of the random walker therefore gives us the best hierarchical clustering
	of the network {\^a}â‚¬'' the optimal number of levels and modular partition
	at each level {\^a}â‚¬'' with respect to the dynamics on the network. With
	a novel search algorithm, we extract and illustrate the rich multilevel
	organization of several large social and biological networks. For
	example, from the global air traffic network we uncover countries
	and continents, and from the pattern of scientific communication
	we reveal more than 100 scientific fields organized in four major
	disciplines: life sciences, physical sciences, ecology and earth
	sciences, and social sciences. In general, we find shallow hierarchical
	structures in globally interconnected systems, such as neural networks,
	and rich multilevel organizations in systems with highly separated

	Abstract = {The amount of available digital multimedia has seen exponential growth
	in recent years. While advances have been made in the indexing and
	searching of images and videos, less focus has been given to aiding
	users in the interactive exploration of large datasets. In this paper
	a new framework, called visual islands , is proposed that reorganizes
	image query results from an initial search or even a general photo
	collection using a fast, non-global feature projection to compute
	2D display coordinates. A prototype system is implemented and evaluated
	with three core goals: fast browsing, intuitive display, and non-linear
	exploration. Using the TRECVID200515 dataset, 10 users evaluated
	the goals over 24 topics. Experiments show that users experience
	improved comprehensibility and achieve a significant page-level precision
	improvement with the visual islands framework over traditional paged
	browsing.},

@article{Liu2008a,
abstract = {This paper proposes a new method for computing page importance, referred to as BrowseRank. The conventional approach to compute page importance is to exploit the link graph of the web and to build a model based on that graph. For instance, PageRank is such an algorithm, which employs a discrete-time Markov process as the model. Unfortunately, the link graph might be incomplete and inaccurate with respect to data for determining page importance, because links can be easily added and deleted by web content creators. In this paper, we propose computing page importance by using a 'user browsing graph' created from user behavior data. In this graph, vertices represent pages and directed edges represent transitions between pages in the users' web browsing history. Furthermore, the lengths of staying time spent on the pages by users are also included. The user browsing graph is more reliable than the link graph for inferring page importance. This paper further proposes using the continuous-time Markov process on the user browsing graph as a model and computing the stationary probability distribution of the process as page importance. An efficient algorithm for this computation has also been devised. In this way, we can leverage hundreds of millions of users' implicit voting on page importance. Experimental results show that BrowseRank indeed outperforms the baseline methods such as PageRank and TrustRank in several tasks.},

But there is still much that can be said objectively about the relative importance of Web pages.

We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.},
